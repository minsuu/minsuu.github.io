* Helped implementing a case study in an autonomous driving car, scaled down to 1/10th. Based on a [F1/10 competition](https://f1tenth.org/) model, I
implemented a sensor fusion that utilizes the sensor data of a depth camera and a LiDAR, with PID control.
* During this, I also made a simple bug fix in the network of ROS, which made UDP transport in ROS much more reliable. ([ros#957](https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/pull/957))"%}
